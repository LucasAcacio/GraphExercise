# GraphExercise

##Requirements:
- Python 3 compiler

## How to use:
- You can use a file to input a graph following the format:
 
 Choose if your graph will be directed or non-directed(d/n)                   
 Choose if your graph will your graph will be weighted or not weighted(w/n)    
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                  
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                                                               
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                                           
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                                           
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                                           
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                                         

- Insert the edge in the format <first_edge> <second_edge> <weight> 
- Weight is only required if you choose a weighted graph
- If you choose a directed graph the <first_edge> will point to <second_edge>
- If you want to just add a vertex, use the format <vertex_A> <vertex_A>

 - You can use input using the command line to input a edge or a vertex one by one
 - This program can process directed, non-directed, weighted and non-weighted graphs
 - After processing you can check vertex adjacency, degree and if 2 vertex are adjacent
