# GraphExercise

## Requirements:
- Python 3 compiler

## How to use:
- You can use a file to input a graph following the format:
 
 Choose if your graph will be directed or non-directed(d/n)                   
 Choose if your graph will your graph will be weighted or not weighted(w/n)    
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                  
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                                                               
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                                           
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                                           
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                                           
 Insert vertex or edge                                                                                         

- Insert the edge in the format "<first_vertex> <second_vertex> <weight>" 
- Weight is only required if you choose a weighted graph
- If you choose a directed graph the "<first_vertex> <second_vertex>" edge will go from first_vertex to second_vertex
- If you want to just add a vertex, use the format "<vertex_A> <vertex_A>"

 - You can use input using the command line to input a edge or a vertex one by one
 - This program can process directed, non-directed, weighted and non-weighted graphs
 - After processing you can check vertex adjacency, degree and if 2 vertex are adjacent calling a post operations list option

 ## Running:
 - run ```~$ python3 main.py``` to execute the program
